# Hedron's std::filesystem Backport for Bazel â€” License

We've received a bunch of requests to release our various Bazel tools for everyone to use.
Together, let's make what was originally a handy, Hedron-internal tool more useful to more people. We hope that it's a win for you!

**Goals:**

- Primarily: Release something useful and encourage collaboration on improvements. You get to use it; we all benefit from improvements. Make the world a little happier and more efficient!
- We'd also like to stay safe from opening ourselves up to liability or lawsuits for trying to provide free help by releasing this software...
- We're looking forward to learning and growing along the way.

[For clarity: This is intended to be a source-available & contribution-encouraging license of Hedron code; we're trying to broaden usage and improvements, but not make it FSF-style free software or similar. We're trying to help--but also retain some rights. If that doesn't work for your needs, though, let's talk! There are open, friendly, learning humans behind this :) ]

The actual license follows (and controls). By downloading or using the software or any related content in this repository (the "Software"), you agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this agreement, please do not download, use, or contribute to the Software.

> Note: These terms apply only use of this Software, i.e. the BUILD rules and related files in this repository. The 3rd party dependencies the Software helps you download and build come with their own separate licenses.
