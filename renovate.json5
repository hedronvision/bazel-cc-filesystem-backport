// Hey Friendly Face reading this :)
// This is the configuration file for Renovate, a GitHub App that can automate dependency updates.

// If you're here, you're probably looking to:
// (1) Make updates for a dependency fully automated. Whitelist it at <TAG0>
// (2) Add CI. Remove "requiredStatusChecks", below.
// (3) Customize Renovate behavior further.
  // For docs, see: https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/
  // To debug, it can be helpful to looks at Renovate's runs/logs: https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard#github/hedronvision/bazel-cc-filesystem-backport
  // This file is .json5, so we can have helpful comments, like this one :) [Normal JSON, Renovate's default, has no comments.]
// (4) Learn about what's going on here and what Renovate can do. Read on :)
// If you need more help, contact @cpsauer.
